# Jagoda'a assistant

Jagoda is a very successful Stand Up Comedian who needs someone to help her spend less time doing borign stuff (sending emails, exporting customer information from stripe payments, managing FB marketing campaigns), and more time writing good jokes, performing, making people laugh (hey, this world needs more of that) and of course earning a living, because she has to pay a mortgage.

This project is a Claude Code based solution that can automate Jagoda's work.

The set of initial features is limited, but it will keep on expanding pretty soon.

## Features

- Export of emails and phone numbers of people who bought tickets for a given show from Stripe.
